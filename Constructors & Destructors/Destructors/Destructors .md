# Destructor 
- It is an instance member function which is invoked automatically whenever an object is going to be destroyed. 
Meaning, a destructor is the last function that is going to be called before an object is destroyed.
- has the same name as their class name preceded by a tilde (~) symbol.
- It is not possible to define more than one destructor.
- It is only one way to destroy the object create by constructor. Hence destructor can-not be overloaded.
- It neither requires any argument nor returns any value.
- It is automatically called when object goes out of scope.
