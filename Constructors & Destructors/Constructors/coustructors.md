#  constructor
- a special type of member function that is called automatically when an object is created.
- In C++, a constructor has the same name as that of the class and it does not have a return type.
###  Default Constructor:
-  A constructor with no parameters is known as a default constructor.
### Parameterized Constructor:
-   a constructor with parameters  
-   This is the preferred method to initialize member data
-  When you have a parameterized constructor it will override the default constructor.
